                        description="The Ecological Network Simulator is a python project that takes a list of input species and produces a network with species as nodes and edges conveying predator/prey relationships.

Relations between species are determined by the Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) API. Only the predator --> prey relationship is shown in graph examples, however the reverse is also supported through the get_prey_list and get_predator_list methods. Classification of species and their common names is provided by the iNaturalist API."
